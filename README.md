### "OlÃ¡ pessoal!" \o/ ğŸ‘‹

My name is Amanda Gundes, and I am from Brazil (ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·). I have an engineering degree which made me learn and understand the best way to link numbers and strategies. I have been working as a Business Analyst since the beggining of 2020 and now I am changing my career to become a Full Stack Developer :)

Would you like to find me?
